### this is DES algorithm for encryption and decryption of folders
### to try run the DesDriver class 
### user has to input the key of encryotion or decryption
### the minimum length of DES key is 64 bit "8 characters" 
### DES algorith is symmetric so the encryption key and decription key must be the same
### in case of encryption user has to input the path of plainfile "the file which he want to encrypte" and the path of the encrypted file
### in case of the decryption user has to input the path of encrypted en decrypted file
